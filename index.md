## Currently

Finishing Math PhD in July 2026 looking for a software related role after.
My research is on tensors, in particular, their algebraic invariants.
Two of my projects are faster algorithms to compute these invariants and proving a local-to-global theory.

## Previously

Senior Staff Software Engineer at Coursera. 

Responsibilities included shepherding Coursera's Scala to Java transition, advising on product architecture, and driving a high reliability culture in a 200 people engineering organization.


## Experiences

### Colorado State University (2021-Present)

Doing my Math PhD with Professor James B. Wilson on studying the algebraic invariants of tensors. 
During my PhD, I also explored formalized computation in Lean, Computational Group Theory, and Type Theory. My dissertation work is explained in my [prelim](https://slides.com/chrisliu/prelim/).


### Coursera (2015-2021)
<br/>
*I think of myself as having 3 careers at Coursera, they are as follows*

__(2019-2021) Ending as the first internally promoted Senior Staff Software Engineer__ (I was the founding member of Coursera's Technical Architecture Group and was in the Growth and Infrastructure teams.)

- Served in Site Reliability Engineering. Advanced reliability culture through tools, frameworks, and education. Results included sending weekly call-graph reports to the organization to understand API fanout. Also began culture of profiling services through flame graphs and an understanding of the tradeoffs of threading vs asynchronous requests.
- Served in technical architecture group. Guided and documented key technical decisions, in particular, the one to move to use Java as the next main backend language at Coursera.
- Started application architecture group by defining the group's charter, roadmap, interfaces, and priorities. Decisions in the group were informed by organizational needs, industry trends, and existing tooling.
- Implemented application architecture on top of Spring Framework by integrating with Coursera's existing tooling. This includes service discovery (Envoy), deployment tooling (AWS EC2/ECS), internal service gateway, and internal data schema technology. This allowed the new Java platform to be a first class citizen within the Coursera technology stack.

<br/>
__(2017-2019) Ending as a Staff Software Engineer__ (I was in the Growth engineering team)

- Redesigned Coursera catalog search infrastructure from Solr to Algolia. Improved performance (10x speedup), reliability, reduced operational overhead, and made ranking explainable to product and marketing stakeholders. 
More details [here](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/the-evolution-of-coursera-search-enabling-product-innovation-through-technical-innovation-6658617cc330).
- Expanded in-course intervention systems to enable experimentation, personalization, and out-of-course targeting. More details [here](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/an-engineers-perspective-on-engineering-and-data-science-collaboration-for-data-products-84cf9b38cd52).
- Built a recommendation modules framework for consistent display, updates, and iteration across product surfaces.
- Drove growth org investment in web performance. This was done by understanding the Server Side Rendering (SSR) architecture and frontend toolchain at Coursera, alongside executing a webpack V3 to V4 upgrade. More details [here](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/webpack-3-to-4-facing-the-known-unknowns-and-unknown-unknowns-cdfeb817faf8).

<br/>
__(2015-2017) Ending as a Senior Software Engineer__ (I was on the Analytics team as a Data Infrastructure engineer)

- Built internal data platform as a React/webpack web app, using Scala/Play services to expose data warehouse for company-wide consumption.
- Developed experimentation framework. This required integrating tracking, statistical hypothesis testing, and reporting infrastructure. Results include consistent tracking across web, iOS, and Android.
- Created the first business definitions at Coursera using BI and rollup tables. Integrated data warehouse with BI tools such as Looker and Tableau.
- Maintained data pipelines on top of AWS DataPipeline using Dataduct, a tool my team open sourced and maintained.


<!-- ### Hulu (2014 Intern)
// - Researched and implemented a real time ingestion and querying pipeline using Druid, an open source distributed column oriented data store, handling up to 30k messages/second.
